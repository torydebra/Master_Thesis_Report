The proposed control framework can be applied to different operative scenarios such as waypoint navigation, assisted teleoperation, interaction, landing and grasping. This work extends the results of the TRIDENT and MARIS projects, which were limited to the execution of grasping actions, to other applications taken from the DexROV and ROBUST projects. In particular, simulation results show how the control framework can be used, for example, for pipeline inspection scenarios and deep sea mining exploration."

This paper applies visual servoing mechanisms not only for handling objects, but also for camera calibration and object inspection. A 6-DOF manipulator and a stereo camera head are mounted on separate platforms and are steered independently. In a first phase (calibration phase), camera features are determined like the optical axes and the fields of sharp view. In the second phase (inspection phase), the robot hand carries an object into the field of view of one camera, then approaches the object along the optical axis to the camera, rotates the object for reaching an optimal view, and finally the object shape is inspected in detail. In the third phase (assembly phase), the system localizes a board containing holes of different shapes, determines the hole which fits most appropriate to the object shape, then approaches and arranges the object appropriately. The final object insertion is based on haptic sensors, but is not treated in the paper. At present, the robot system has the competence to handle cylindrical and cuboid pegs. For handling other object categories the system can be extended with more sophisticated strategies of the inspection and/or assembly phase."

Fine motion strategies associated with adjustment operations on a peg-in-hole are fundamental manipulations that can be utilised in dynamic assembly and reconfigurable workholding or fixturing systems. This paper presents a comprehensive study of robotic-based height adjustment of a cylindrical pair based on maintaining minimum contact forces between the links. The outer link is held by the end-effector of a six-DOF (Degrees of freedom) serial articulated robot manipulator. The environment represented by the inner link can be either static or dynamic. A force-based approach and a dvalue approach are established to determine the type of contact that exists between the links of a cylindrical pair, and to extract control parameters. Based on the comparison and analysis of these two approaches, a hybrid methodology is established by combining a dvalue approach with a force-based approach for contact state determination. Formulations capable of extracting necessary control parameters, which ensure minimum contact forces between the links, are established from both planar and spatial viewpoints under both static and dynamic environmental conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.",

Successful completion of peg-in-hole assembly tasks depends on a geometry-based approach for determining the guiding direction, fine contact motion control, and a reference force for the alignment/insertion process as well. Therefore, in this study, we propose a peg-in-hole strategy for complex-shaped parts based on a guidance algorithm. This guidance algorithm is inspired by the study of human motion patterns; that is, the assembly direction selection process and the maximum force threshold are determined through the observation of humans performing similar actions. In order to carry out assembly tasks, an assembly direction is chosen using the spatial arrangement and geometric information of complex-shaped parts, and the required force is decided by kinesthetic teaching with a Gaussian mixture model. In addition, an impedance controller using an admittance filter is implemented to achieve stable contact motion for a position control-based industrial robot. The performance of the proposed assembly strategy was evaluated by experiments using arbitrarily complex-shaped parts with different initial situations.",

The MPCM is a method where position/ orientation perturbation is generated when the female connector and the male connector are connected and the correlation value of the resulting reaction force/moment is used to calculate and to correct the position and orientation errors between the connectors. The successful performance of assembly task within a limited error range can be confirmed by applying the MPCM to DRC-HUBO. When there are errors between the connector, the correlation value can be confirmed to converge to 0 as errors are corrected even though it takes on certain directionality.",

	abstract="In this study, we develop new techniques to sense contact locations and control robots in contact situations in order to enable articulated robotic systems to perform manipulations and grasping actions. Active sensing approaches are investigated by utilizing robot kinematics and geometry to improve upon existing sensing methods for contact. Compliant motion control is used so that a robot can actively search for and localize the desired contact location. Robot control in a contact situation is improved by the precise estimation of the contact location. From this viewpoint, we investigate a new control strategy to accommodate the proposed sensing techniques in contact situations. The proposed estimation algorithm and the control strategy both work complementarily. Then, we verify the proposed algorithm through experiments using 7-DOF hardware and a simulation environment. The two major contributions of the proposed active sensing strategy are the estimation algorithm for contact location without any tactile sensors, and the control strategy complementing the proposed estimation algorithm.",

	abstract = { Active compliance enables robots to carry out tasks in the presence of significant sensing and control errors. Compliant motions are quite difficult for humans to specify, however. Furthermore, robot programs are quite sensitive to details of geometry and to error characteristics and must, therefore, be constructed anew for each task. These factors motivate the search for automatic synthesis tools for robot program ming, especially for compliant motion. This paper describes a formal approach to the synthesis of compliant-motion strategies from geometric descriptions of assembly operations and explicit estimates of errors in sensing and control. A key aspect of the approach is that it provides criteriafor correct ness of compliant-motion strategies. }
