\begin{acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my mother, my father, and my whole family, without who I would not be here. I would like to thank my sweetheart and my love, Sara (aka Cucurucho) which has always supported me and she always will. She was also really important for reviewing my English.\\
I would like to thank the Spanish lab, IRSLab, especially Javier, who really helped me a lot despite every morning at 10:12 he distracted me with Spanish almuerzos. I would like also to thank professors from my home country, professor Giuseppe Casalino, and professor Enrico Simetti, my two thesis supervisors. I want also to remember my Spanish supervisors, Professor Pedro J. Sanz and Professor Raul Marin Prades.\\
I think that I have to thank also my colleague and friend, Fabio. He distracted me, too, with a lot of very long telephone calls. Anyway they were useful for him to learn something from me =). \textit{Maybe}, \textit{sometimes}, they were also useful for me.\\
Last but not least, I have to thank myself, because I'm great. Bravo Tori.
