I would like to thank my mother, my father, and my whole family, without whom I would not be here. I would to thank my sweetheart and my love, Sara (aka Cucurucho) which has always supported me and always will do. She was also really important for reviewing my English.\\
I would like to thank the Spanish lab, IRSLab, especially Javier, whom really help me a lot despite every morning at 10:12 he distracted me with Spanish almuerzos. I would also to thank professors from my home country, Professor Giuseppe Casalino, and Ernico Simetti, my two thesis relators. I want also to remember my Spanish Supervisors, Professor Pedro J. Sanz and Professor Raul Marin Prades.\\
I think that I have to thanks also my colleague and friend, Fabio. Also him distracted me a lot with very long telephone calls, anyway they were useful for him to learn something from me =) . \textit{Maybe}, \textit{sometimes} it was also useful for me.\\
Last but not least, I have to thank myself, because I'm great. Bravo Tori.
